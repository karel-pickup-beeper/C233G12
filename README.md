This game is a collaborative project between Feifei Zhang, Vincent Tsin, Mark Pineda, Yasmin Samantar.<br/>


Karel RPG is a role playing game that allows a player to explore a preset map. The objective of the game is to defeat all the enemies within the room and collect all the items. <br/>

The game features a player controlled by using the keyboard ([W, A, S, D] to move, [T] to attack, [P] to pickup an item). The game also features a battle system, wherein, each enemy has it's on health and will die if it's life points are reduced to zero. The collection system is implemented to supplement the game objective. Lastly, The GUI interface, reacts to the user inputs. For example, when the enemy is attacked, and loses all its health, it will disappear from the map. The collectible item will also disappear, when the player picks the item up. <br/>
